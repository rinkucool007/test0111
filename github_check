# Unix

Generating a new SSH key
Open Git Bash.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.

Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent
# start the ssh-agent in the background
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
> Agent pid 59566


Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_ed25519 in the command with the name of your private key file.

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
